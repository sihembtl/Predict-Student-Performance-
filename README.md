# Student-Performance-Prediction
Using Machine learning to predict a student final grade

- I made this project to  practices and experement with some of the dimentsionality reduction techniques like low variance filter, cheking multicollinearity, random forest feature importance and principal component analysis 
- I also did an Exploratory Analysis and a BI report using PowerBI to answer some of the questions that came to my mind because i was interested in knowing how some of the variables impact the students grades
- through out the whole project i prefered to use Spyder rather than Jupyter Notebook becuase of Spyder's variable Explorer which enables you to see the data in a very clear way without the need to use print
